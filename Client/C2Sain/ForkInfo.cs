// ForkInfo.cs -- identity of the C2/SAIN fork build.
//
// Read by MiyakoCarryServiceClient.Start (startup log line) and ForkDebug (the
// in-raid debug overlay), so a log or screenshot names the build it came from.
// This fork keeps no analyzable records (it writes only to the BepInEx log), so
// one behaviour counter is enough; there is no schema version.

        ///  1 (2026-11-04) Phase 2 core: SAIN layers kept (minus Extract/Debug), the game's
        ///    AvoidDanger and Malfunction layers kept, a priority-19 Guard layer added, team modes
        ///    C2 / Guard / Combat, the SAIN decision leash (3-5 s chases), Break off from combat,
        ///    gap crossing and MCS fast doors off by default, follow spots must be in the player's
        ///    line on the navmesh, "too far" fixed (was ~4.5 m). Measured: nothing yet; this is
        ///    the first in-raid test build. Falsifier: if guard/combat hand-offs make bots freeze
        ///    or flap between layers in the user's raid test, the gate in C2Gate goes back.
        ///  2 (2026-11-04) Test build 2, from the user's raid on bigmap with build 1 (debug dump
        ///    12-51-50: McsGuardLayer chosen 3103 times, SAIN Combat Layer 634, C2Sain:ToGuardSpot
