// ForkInfo.cs -- identity of the C2/SAIN fork build.
//
// Read by MiyakoCarryServiceClient.Start (startup log line) and ForkDebug (the
// in-raid debug overlay), so a log or screenshot names the build it came from.
// This fork keeps no analyzable records (it writes only to the BepInEx log), so
// one behaviour counter is enough; there is no schema version.

        /// Changelog:
        ///  1 (2026-11-04) Phase 2 core: SAIN layers kept (minus Extract/Debug), the game's
        ///    AvoidDanger and Malfunction layers kept, a priority-19 Guard layer added, team modes
        ///    C2 / Guard / Combat, the SAIN decision leash (3-5 s chases), Break off from combat,
        ///    gap crossing and MCS fast doors off by default, follow spots must be in the player's
        ///    line on the navmesh, "too far" fixed (was ~4.5 m). Measured: nothing yet; this is
        ///    the first in-raid test build. Falsifier: if guard/combat hand-offs make bots freeze
        ///    or flap between layers in the user's raid test, the gate in C2Gate goes back.
        ///  2 (2026-11-04) Test build 2, from the user's raid on bigmap with build 1 (debug dump
        ///    12-51-50: McsGuardLayer chosen 3103 times, SAIN Combat Layer 634, C2Sain:ToGuardSpot
        ///    1586, C2Sain:Watch 1453, one NullReferenceException from MCS's CalcGoalEnemy in
        ///    EnemyInfo.SetVisible; the user saw no freezes or layer flapping, so build 1's
        ///    falsifier did not fire). Added: Engage Enemy (SAIN's Chad personality, flanking,
        ///    covering fire), Engage Enemy Wrecklessly (GigaChad or Wreckless), "I see the enemy"
        ///    (contact report: guard facing the mark, enemy handed to SAIN as a squadmate
        ///    sighting), a carry-bot personality setting (one of the user's four bots rolled
        ///    Coward), bush concealment for guard spots and a see-out radius for foliage around
        ///    carry bots, Escort pacing (3 s sprints, 3-5 s watchful walks, waits for the player),
        ///    out-of-combat stims off by default, On Your Own removed, Clear Area renamed Clear
        ///    Target Area and refused in contact, MCS's enemy sharing turned into SAIN squadmate
        ///    sightings. Falsifiers: an Engage order that leaves a bot more than 60 m from the
        ///    player after it ends, or carry bots shooting through bushes farther away than the
        ///    see-out radius, sends that part back.
        ///  3 (2026-11-04) Test build 3, from the user's raid with build 2 ("performing
        ///    phenomenally"; a Goons fight cost 2 of 4 carry bots, which the user wanted: a two-way
        ///    fight). Neither build-2 falsifier was reported. Their notes: guards bunched on one side
        ///    of the player, hugged the player too closely to use cover right beside them, and copied
        ///    the player's crouch during Clear Area. Traced: each bot picked its own spot in its own
        ///    sector and, when that sector had no usable spot, fell back to a follow spot on the side
        ///    it stood on (bots trail the player, so all landed behind); and one ray from a random
        ///    point rarely hits a tree trunk. Changed: guard posts are planned per squad
        ///    (GuardPlanner): 2+ bots outdoors form an even detail 3-12 m out (setting), behind trees,
        ///    rocks, walls, vehicles or bushes when near; indoors they post on the busiest approaches
        ///    (routes traced to 12-35 m away, other floors included); a lone bot watches the
        ///    player's back; contact reports still fan toward the mark. Lean-around cover (a trunk
        ///    or rock) now scores as full cover. The player's pose is copied only while following or
        ///    escorting (MovePolicy), so Escort crouch-walks with a crouching player and Clear Area,
        ///    Go To Point, proxy tasks and Break off never copy it. Falsifiers: with 2+ bots, guards
        ///    still ending up together on one side outdoors, or indoor posts inside side rooms rather
        ///    than on hallways and stairs, sends the planner back for rework.
